## Description
This project was created to fine tune my web development skills in the areas of both jquery and AJAX methods using APIs. The objective was to create a simple weather dashboard which would display a search area to the left and a weather rendering area to the right, which included both a "current weather" card and also a "5-day forecast" card.

## Usage
When the page loads, enter a US city name using proper spacing and click the search button. Not entering an input will render no results.
The page will load current weather data for the input city and a 5-day forecast. Additionally, the app is enabled with geolocation functionality which will render the same currrent weather and 5-day forecast data. This function is executed by clicking the green location button in the top left corner.
